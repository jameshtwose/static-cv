To whom it may concern,

I am currently working as a data scientist/ machine learning 
engineer for a MedTech start up called Neurocast. 
Whilst this is incredibly rewarding, I have worked there for 
the last 4 years and so am now looking for a different 
place to be able to grow and improve in.

I think Spotify is the perfect place to do this, 
and this role especially, because I love the 
opportunity to use data science in a creative way, 
I enjoy being able to experiment but also to 
create sustainable pipelines and workflows, 
and I find it very rewarding translating data 
problems to informative insight for others. 

I hope you have all the information you need, 
and if not please feel free to reach out.

I look forward to hearing from you.

James
