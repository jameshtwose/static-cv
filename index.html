<h3 id="data-engineer---event-connectors-feb-2023---may-2023">Data
Engineer - Event Connectors (Feb 2023 - May 2023)</h3>
<p>At Event Connectors, I was hired to create pipelines and frontend
code to build an internal dashboard, which is used to monitor one of
Event Connectors’ products, Feed Factory. Feed Factory is the interface
used by municipalities throughout the Netherlands to organize and manage
the activities and events in their respective areas. With the work I
did, I was able to provide insight into the number of scheduled events
managed through Feed Factory, and the associated amount of time saved by
using this product.</p>
<p>Used CI/CD via github actions. Using Docker containers, this was how
we delivered the APIs.</p>
<p>More specifically, my responsibilities included: - Setting up
PostgreSQL backend (PostgreSQL/SQLAlchemy), retrieving data from various
APIs (previous infrastructure used MongoDB and Elasticsearch)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creating middleware to communicate with the backend so that the
frontend can easily and quickly retrieve data for figures and tables
(FastAPI, Docker)</p></li>
<li><p>Create cron jobs to automatically update the backend when new
input occurs every day (SQLAlchemy, GitHub actions)</p></li>
<li><p>Create plots and MVPs for frontend engineers to integrate into
the main application (plotly.js, react.js)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-scientist---citizen-shield-june-2021---may-2023">Data
Scientist - Citizen Shield (June 2021 - May 2023)</h3>
<p>Citizen Shield is an initiative of the Finnish government to provide
technological, behavioral and societal solutions for protective actions
to tackle pandemics in Finland. My role within this project was to
analyze and describe the results of a large nationwide survey aimed at
understanding the behavioral determinants leading to the use of masks in
Finnish culture. On this basis, research policy has been drawn up and/or
adapted to better respond to pandemics in Finland in the future. For
this project I acted as a Data Scientist, with the following
responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Analysis (Python, Catboost, shap, statsmodels, pingouin,
streamlit)</li>
<li>Data Visualization (Python, streamlit, plotly, HTML, CSS)</li>
<li>Writing an academic article</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="data-engineer-data-scientist---neurocast-apr-2021---apr-2023">Data
Engineer &amp; Data Scientist - Neurocast (Apr 2021 - Apr 2023)</h3>
<p>Supervising junior data scientists. Tasked with researching and
creating tailor-made analytical methods to monitor and predict changes
in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) based on data collected from smartphones.
Inspiration for these approaches comes from complex systems science
(e.g. Recurrence Quantification Analysis), optimal control theory
(e.g. Licitra et al., 2018), electrical engineering (e.g. Single Input
Single Output systems) and neuroscience (e.g. Subtype and Stage
Inference ).</p>
<p>In addition, we have created AI models in AWS Sagemaker for the
following purposes. Anomaly detection: find out who the user of a phone
is, yourself or someone else, activity classification: find out whether
the user is walking, sitting or standing based on typing behavior. In
addition, predicting symptom worsening (in this case in people with
muscular disease MS) based on sensor data.</p>
<p>Used CI/CD via github actions.</p>
<p>Responsibilities: - Data Engineering - python (AWS S3, AWS RDS,
boto3, pandas, polars, MySQL, pytest, GitHub actions) - Data Analysis -

id="medior-data-engineer-data-scientist---neurocast-apr-2020---apr-2021">Medior
Data Engineer &amp; Data Scientist - Neurocast (Apr 2020 - Apr
2021)</h3>
<p>At Neurocast I was the lead data scientist appointed to perform
analyses in collaboration with the Amsterdam University Medical Center.
This collaboration, intended to validate the use of smartphone
interactions as a means to monitor and predict outcomes in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), led to a cross-sectional journal article, a
responsiveness journal article, and a longitudinal journal article.</p>
<p>Responsibilities: - Data Engineering - python (AWS S3, AWS RDS,

<p>Created a machine learning workflow and performed an assortment of
machine learning analytics (SVM, Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptron
etc.) to predict MS outcome measures using keystroke data. These
analyzes were all internal, but an example of a similar approach is
available upon request.</p>
<p>Responsibilities: - Data Engineering - python (AWS S3, AWS RDS,
boto3, pandas, MySQL, tsfresh, SQLAlchemy) - Data Analysis - python
(sklearn, MERF, jupyter, seaborn, matplotlib) - Stakeholder management

<h3 id="junior-data-scientist---neurocast-apr-2018---apr-2019">Junior
Data Scientist - Neurocast (Apr 2018 - Apr 2019)</h3>
<p>Applied non-linear time series analyzes - specifically dynamic
complexity of keystroke dynamics to match fluctuations in keystroke data
with clinically relevant changes in outcome measures. This resulted in
the following journal article: ‘Twose et al, 2020’. Also looked at using
Mixed Effects Random Forests to predict MS outcomes, taking into account
the hierarchical nature of clinical data and still applying a non-linear
approach (as opposed to Linear Mixed models).</p>
<p>Responsibilities: - Data Engineering - python (AWS S3, AWS RDS,
boto3, pandas, MySQL, SQLAlchemy) - Data Analysis - python, R (sklearn,
